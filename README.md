Requirements
The basic requirements necessary to fulfill the goals of this assignment are:

Create a mobile-friendly header that can serve as a prototype for your final 
project.
Create a mobile-friendly layout for the various sections of the page.
Create a mobile-friendly footer to display relevant information.
Use media queries, Bootstrap components, and jQuery to modify the layout and 
display of the page for at least four screen sizes: mobile (phone), tablet, 
desktop and television.
The resolution breakpoints we will use for these four sizes are the default 
Bootstrap breakpoints:

Extra Small (xs): less than 768px wide (phones)
Small (sm): 768px to 991px wide (tablets)
Medium (md): 992px to 1199px wide (desktops)
Large (lg): 1200px or more wide (televisions, large desktops, etc.)

Base Requirements

Come up with the concept for a single-page (at least) experience combining HTML, 
CSS, and JS.
Come up with a lovely design that does justice to your concept.
Implement your concept and design in HTML, CSS, and JS.
Be sure that your concept meets these technical requirements:
Use at least one third party library (probably jQuery) to assist with base 
dom manipulation and programming.
Use at least one third party library (perhaps Bootstrap) to assist with some 
aspect of visual presentation and/or visual effects (you could also use a third 
party animation library, etc.).
Use at least one third party library to incorporate data from a remote service. 
(This could be implementation of a mapping library like Leaflet.js, some JS 
components for Flickr or Twitter, or a completely custom API request/feature 
that you create using "ajax()" or "getJSON()" methods.
Use at least one event listener to respond to a user's click. (This could be 
doing a show/hide on content, simulating a login, triggering an animation, etc.)
Your design and layout must be responsive for the four common sizes of screen: 
sm, md, lg, xl.
